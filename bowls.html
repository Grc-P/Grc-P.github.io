    <h2> The Little Green Bowl </h2>
    <div class="bowl_imgs1">
        <img src= "resources/images/optimised/bowls_page/Green_bowl.webp" alt = "little bowl, grene on inside navy/bwon on the outside">
    </div>
    <p> I will never make a bowl more beautiful than this. This is my favourite thing I have ever made (except for /that/ green mug). I love how the color on the outside is dark, a mixture of brown and navy and then there is this vibrant green on the inside. The contrast between the two sides is really interesting and I hope to make a lot more in this style, although it is a bit of a pain to do. The bowls must first be dipped in Jupiter brown glaze, before having white poured in the center of the bowl. You have to pour enough white to cover the inside without adding too much that it would cause the glaze to crawl. You also have to make sure that you dont accidentally drip and onto the outside - a mistake I have made with one of my most recent pots (glaze firing pending, images coming soon).</p>
    <p> In the future I will aim to use less inside glaze colour than needed and then manually add the remaining glaze by hand - I think this is the best was to control where the glaze goes going forward.
    </p>
    <h2> Wide Bowls</h2>
    <div class = "bowl_imgs2">
        <img src= "./resources/images/optimised/bowls_page/purple_bowl_above.webp"  alt = "purple and white bowl from above">
        <img src="./resources/images/optimised/bowls_page/pasta_bowls.webp" alt= "freshly thrown pasta bowls">
    </div> 
    <p> To the left is a one of the first bowls I made. The glaze has crawled a bit on this one (due to the glaze being too thick) but it has created a beautiful floral effect across the bowl.</p>
    <p> On the right hand side are two freshly thrown pasta bowls. These are the most recent and largest pieces I have ever made, requiring 1kg of clay each. I am not convinced they they will survive the turning and firing processes but I will remain hopeful</p>
    <h2> Maggie's Bowl </h2>
    <div class="bowl_imgs3">
        <img src="resources/images/optimised/bowls_page/blue_bowl_pre_glaze.webp" alt= "various bowls and mugs in different colours">
    </div>
    <p> This bowl is for Maggie. The test tile in front shows the color I'm hoping it will come out as, but you can never be sure.</p>
