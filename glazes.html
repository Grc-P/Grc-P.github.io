            <p> If you ever manage to get to the point where you have a bisque fired pot still intact, then glazing can be the final process to tranform your pot into a beatuful piece of art, or something worthy of the back of a cupboard. </p>
            <p> The success rate is low and the amount of hours you will spend battling with the clay could never be reflected in a price tag palatable by today's consumers. So no I will not be selling my pots.</p>
            <p> Here are some images of the process:</p>

    <h2> Test Tiles</h2>

    </div> 
 
    <p>It can be useful to make small test tiles dipped in different glaze combinations to get an idea of the colours they produce.
         The idea is that this avoids you having to sacrific and of your pots to find out glaze colours once fired. 
         Although temperature variations thourghout the kiln can mean that pots dipped in the exact same glazes can come out very different colours, rendering the test tiles somewhat useless (see example further below). <p/>

    <h2>Glaze Application </h2>

    <p> Dunk it once, dunk it twice, its up to you depending on the desired effect. My favourite combination is Jupiter (brown) and white which creates a beautiful marbled green colour after the firing process.
        Reccently I have been experimenting with with only putting a second colour on the inside of bowls or dipping mugs in such a way as to create an angle of colour (yet to find out if this looks terrible). Have a look at the examples below:

    <h2> Glazing Gone Wrong</h2>
    <p> Coming soon - a collection of glazed pots that didn't turn out as expected. I don't have any photos of them already because they are too shameful.</p>
