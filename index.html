            <p class="intro">Plans are for the highly skilled master potter, which I am not. I instead see where the clay takes me in the moment, sometimes that mug turns into a bowl, and vice versa. There is no consistency to my forms, nor can I make anything larger than my hand.</p>
            <p> Using this website as a little record of my journey as a potter. This is not in anyway serious, just a bit of fun. Also there is no built in spell checker for this coding software so enjoy spotting all the mistakes. Welcome along for the ride. </p>
