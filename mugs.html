         <h2> Mugs of all shapes and sizes</h2>
            <p class="intro"> Not to sound too pretentious but I think there is something really special about a handmade mug. They have so much character and you discver something new about their form each time you use them. This is a far cry from the lifeless design of mass produced mugs. 
                Here are some of the mugs I have made so far:</p>
    </div>

    <h2> The Matcha Mug </h2>
    <div class = "mug_imgs1">
        <img src="resources/images/black_mug.jpg" alt= "black curvy mug">
        <img src="resources/images/matcha_mug.jpg" alt= "black mug filled with matcha" >
    </div>
    <p> Felt a bit mugged off when I saw the colour of this one after glaze firing. It was supposed to be a beatiful blue colour(see middle test tile on the glazing page) but instead came out black.
        It is growing on me though, I like the shape and it looks pretty cool with my matcha in it, like a potion in a cauldron or something.</p>
      <h2> The Tooth Brush Holder</h2>
        <div class = "mug_imgs2">
         <img src = "resources/images/blue-pot.jpg" alt= "handle-less blue mug (i.e just a pot)">
        <img src = "resources/images/tooth_brush_pot.jpg" alt= "handle-less blue swirly mug with toothbrushes in it">
    </div>
        <p> This was meant to be a mug but it was too thick and heavy  and I also let it dry too much before I added a handle to it. It is discouraged to join together pieces of clay with different levels of moisture in them as this can lead to uneven shrinking of the clay and cracking.
            It is now instead a tooth brush holder in bathroom blue. </p>

   <h2> The Little Green Mug</h2>
    <div class = "mug_imgs3">
        <img src="resources/images/green_mug_side.jpg" alt = "green mug side">
         <img src="resources/images/green_mug_back.jpg" alt = "unglazed bowl and mug">

    </div>
    <p> My favourite mug and one of the first I made. A thing of beauty. Dedicated to the best coconut shy player in Yorkshire, and probably the world.</p>

    <div class="rip">
        <h2> Fallen Mugs</h2>
        <p> Mugs that didn't make it- either killed in the kiln or smashed accidentally. Gone but never forgotten:</p>
